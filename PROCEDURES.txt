BEFORE STARTING ANYTHING:
--CHECK MONITOR SETTINGS: right click on desktop>proprieta>Impostazioni>Avanzate>Monitor
--MONITOR REFRESH RATE: 85HZ
--MONITOR RESOLUTION: 1280 x 1024
--OPEN: MATLAB 2006a
--PATH TO PROJECT FOLDERS: C:\Programmi\MATLAB\R2006a\work\Lisandro
--Add 'C:\Programmi\MATLAB\R2006a\work\Lisandro\Psychophysics' to the path:
  File>Set Path>Add with subfolders .. indicate the path. Do not save, only close.
--MAKER SURE YOU HAVE THE HEXAGONAL INSTRUMENTS!

!!!ASK SUBJECT IF THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF EPILEPSY!!! FAST FREQUENCY CHECKERBOARD CAN BE DANGEROUS!!!

STEREOSCOPE CALIBRATION:
-- IN THE DARK SO SUBJECT ADAPTS TO THE CONDITIONS
-- runExp WITH Block_Practice_NoMondrian, STOP AT WHEN FRAMES PRESENTED 
-- THE SUBJECT SHOULD ONLY SEE THE LEFT FRAME WITH THE LEFT EYE 
   (CHECK THAT HE/SHE IS NOT SEEING ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE MIRROW).
-- THE SUBJECT SHOULD ONLY SEE THE RIGHT FRAME WITH THE RIGHT EYE 
   (CHECK THAT HE/SHE IS NOT SEEING ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE MIRROW).
-- CHECK BINOCULAR FUSION (ONE FIXATE, ONE FRAME, ONE FIXATION DOT PERCEIVED).


EXPERIMENT:

Verbal:
--EXPLAIN THE TASK

Eye dominance:
--DETERMINE THE DOMINANT EYE, MONDRIANS MUST GO TO THAT EYE.
  (CHANGE IN runExp: Exp.stimuli.mondrianEyeLocation = 1 or 2).

Set the function for accuracy check:
--ENABLE THE CORRECT FUNCTION FOR PLOTTING ACCURACY AFTER EACH BLOCK
(CHANGE IN runExp: bottom of script, in cell titled "Accuracy check")

Practice:
--RUN PRACTICE OF CHECKERBOARDS WITHOUT MONDRIANS
  (MAKE THE SUBJECT FAMILIAR WITH THE CHECKERBOARDS): Block_Practice_NoMondrian
  STOP WHEN SUBJECT FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH CHECKERBOARDS
--RUN PRACTICE OF CHECKERBOARDS WITH MONDRIANS (SOME VISIBLE, SOME NOT)
  (IT TAKES SOME TIME FOR SUBJECTS TO GET USED TO MONDRIANS): Block_Practice_WithMondrian
  DO THE WHOLE 48 TRIAL BLOCK

Actual experiment:
-- Example of how to enter subject ID:
   S01_AF_06062011_01  -meaning- S<subject 01<number, AF<initials, 06062011<date, 01<block number 

--RUN FIRST BLOCK OF THE EXPERIMENT: Block_Main
--AT THE END OF FIRST BLOCK ACCURACY PLOT APPEARS,
  CHECK THAT THE SUBJECT IS IN THE CORRECT RANGE OF RESPONSES  
 (LOWER CONTRASTS AROUND CHANCE(25%), HIGHER CONTRASTS AT 100% IF NOT,
  WE USE THE FIRST BLOCK AS PRACTICE AND NEED TO RUN ONE MORE AT THE END)
--IF ALL IS GOOD, CONTINUE WITH THE NEXT 5 BLOCKS. COLLECT 6 VALID BLOCKS IN TOTAL
 (BEFORE EACH BLOCK DO A QUICK CHECK OF RIGHT/LEFT EYE VISIBILITY AND FUSION) 

After experiment:
--ASK SUBJECT TO REPORT ANY OBSERVATION HE/SHE MAY HAVE REGARDING THE EXPERIMENT
--THANK YOU, SUBJECT!
--COLLECT DATA FROM THE LAB COMPUTER: 1)Raw dta files, 2)Individual block accuracies' jpgs.
