
BEFORE STARTING ANYTHING:

--MONITOR REFRESH RATE: 100HZ
--MONITOR RESOLUTION: 1280 x 1024
--Add 'C:\Programmi\MATLAB\R2006a\work\Lisandro\Psychophysics' to the path

STEREOSCOPE CALIBRATION:

-- THE SUBJECT SHOULD ONLY SEE THE LEFT FRAME WITH THE LEFT EYE (CHECK THAT HE/SHE IS NOT SEEING ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE MIRROW).
-- THE SUBJECT SHOULD ONLY SEE THE RIGHT FRAME WITH THE RIGHT EYE (CHECK THAT HE/SHE IS NOT SEEING ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE MIRROW).
-- CHECK BINOCULAR FUSION (ONE FIXATE, ONE FRAME, ONE FIXATION DOT PERCEIVED).


EXPERIMENT:

--EXPLAIN THE TASK
--RUN PRACTICE OF CHECKERBOARDS WITHOUT MONDRIANS (MAKE THE SUBJECT FAMILIAR WITH THE CHECKERBOARDS)
--RUN PRACTICE OF CHECKERBOARDS WITH MONDRIANS (IT TAKES SOME TIME FOR SUBJECTS TO GET USED TO MONDRIANS)
--RUN FIRST BLOCK OF THE EXPERIMENT. AT THE END CHECK THAT THE SUBJECT IS ON THE CORRECT RANGE OF RESPONSES FOR THE HIGHER CONTRASTS (IF NOT, WE USE THE FIRST BLOCK AS PRACTICE AND NEED TO RUN ONE MORE AT THE END)

-- S01_AF_06062011_01 this is an example of how to enter subject number, initials, date, and block number at start of exp.


DATA ANALYSIS:

1- analyze_concatenateData (specifying the files to search inside the function)
