Things to do:

# Create the trials figure


% HISTORY

-- Change question order: 1st appear the arrows; 2nd appear 'yes'/'no'  	%#OK

-- Radomize location of 'yes'/'no': sometimes left/right, sometimes right/left. 
    Added the decoding of responses depending on whether it is 'yes'/'no' OR 'no'/'yes'

-- Create text file with instructions for running the experiment (e.g., set monitor refresh rate to 100Hz, etc.) %#OK

-- Program the backward, forward and middle masking conditions 		%#OK

--15062011 Check that computer hardware is functioning properly - i.e. - that flips are not missed. Use Profiler  %#OK

	Put the temporal frequency at 8.5 hz  %#OK.

	Redefine contrast values to: 4, 12, 16, 24, 64. %#OK

	Add the condition of middle after the first mask (visual masking condition). %#OK

	Program practice trials: WITH AND WITHOUT MONDRIANS %OK. 

	DO not randomize the yes - no response  %OK 

	Test the accuracy of responses after the first block for ceiling. %OK

	# Scripted analyze_subjective.m: analyses of accuracy as a function of p(yes)

	# After seeing the results we decided on the parameters for the next experiment
