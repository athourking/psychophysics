Things to do:

Put the temporal frequency at 8.5 hz  %#OK.

Redefine contrast values to: 4, 12, 16, 24, 64. %#OK

Add the condition of middle after the first mask (visual masking condition). %#OK

Program practice trials: WITH AND WITHOUT MONDRIANS

DO not randomize the yes - no response

Test the accuracy of responses after the first block for ceiling.

Do analyses of accuracy as a function to p(yes). Single participant.


% HISTORY

-- Change question order: 1st appear the arrows; 2nd appear 'yes'/'no'  	%#OK

-- Radomize location of 'yes'/'no': sometimes left/right, sometimes right/left. 
    Added the decoding of responses depending on whether it is 'yes'/'no' OR 'no'/'yes'

-- Create text file with instructions for running the experiment (e.g., set monitor refresh rate to 100Hz, etc.) %#OK

-- Program the backward, forward and middle masking conditions 		%#OK

-- Checkeed that computer hardware is functioning properly - i.e. - that flips are not missed. Use Profiler  %#OK
