Things to do:

Redefine contrast values to: 4, 12, 16, 24, 64, 96. Create the appropriate block of trials. UNIT TEST!!

-7. Check that computer hardware is functioning properly - i.e. - that flips are not missed. Use Profiler


-6. Program practice trials: WITH AND WITHOUT MONDRIANS


% HISTORY

Change question order: 
1st appear the arrows; 
2nd appear 'yes'/'no'  	%#OK

2 is done! I swapped the subjective and objective response sections in showTrial.
I also added:
the while keyIsDown loop in lines 297-300 so the program waits for key release before going into ITI.
the fixation dot for the 'yes'/'no' screen in lines 225-228 in showTrial 	%#OK


-3. Radomize location of 'yes'/'no': sometimes left/right, sometimes right/left. 

3 is done! I did this in Lines 230 - 241 of showTrial. 	%#OK


-4. Add the decoding of responses depending on whether it is 'yes'/'no' OR 'no'/'yes'.  

4 is done! I did this in Lines 264 & 270-280 of showTrial. %#OK


-5. Create text file with instructions for running the experiment (e.g., set monitor refresh rate to 100Hz, etc.) %#OK

-- Program the backward, forward and middle masking conditions 		%#OK
