Experiment 1: temporal masking

How does the temporal distance between the mask and target affect visibility?

Are there inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the masks with regard to the targets?

Control: checkerboard appearing after the 1st mask

Alessio proposed another way of testing subjects: contrast adjustment method. Subjects have to decrease the contrast of appearing checkerboards until they do not see them anymore.

Experiment 2: frequency of the temporal masking

How does the frequency of presentation of the mondrians affect visibility?


Physiological Experiment:

Does an unseen checkerboard target generate a P1 / early activity in V1?
