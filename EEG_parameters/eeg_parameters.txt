One short training session of 30 trials

Forward masking at 5 Hz with 15% of Michelson contrast.
150 trials in each position + 150 blank trials.
600 trials with checkerboard, 150 blank trials = 750 trials.

After the experiment run a condition to assess only the RTs from the presentation of the stimuli. Let's evaluate how fast people are at detecting the checkerboard.


Analysis:

Behavioral figure with the 4AFC accuracy, the subjective visibility and the d primes, also we could add here the RTs of subjects for the detection of the dots

Main figure to assess P1. We will subtract the blank trials from the trials containing Checkerboards. The compare seen vs unseen.



EEG triggers:

Beginning of first mask: 100
Checkerboard presentation: 1-4 (corresponding to the locations, as in the trial_generator)
End of last mask: 200
